COVID-19 analysis based on Brockmann, Maier SIRX code and on John Hopkins CSSE data
================================================

This code applies the analysis from https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07572 to the daily updated data provided by JHU CSSE https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/ (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

The SIRX code comes from https://github.com/benmaier/COVID19CaseNumberModel (Brockmann, Maier)

See [the notebook](COVID-19 SIRX evaluation.ipynb) for plots. The plots are updated when new data is coming in.
